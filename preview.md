Arithmetic Operators:

1.Write a function calculateArea that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns the area. Use the formula: Area = Length Ã— Width.
Comparison Operators:


2.Create a function isAdult that takes an age as a parameter and returns true if the age is 18 or older, and false otherwise.
Logical Operators:


3.Write a function canAccessContent that takes two parameters: age and isMember. The function should return true if the person is 18 or older or if they are a member, and false otherwise.
Assignment Operators:


4.Create a variable score initialized to 0. Write a series of operations that increase the score by 10, then decrease it by 5, and finally multiply it by 2. Return the final score.
Unary Operators:


5.Write a function countDown that takes a number as a parameter and uses a loop to print the numbers from that number down to 1, using the decrement operator.
Typeof Operator:


6.Create a function checkDataType that takes a variable as a parameter and returns a string indicating its type (e.g., "string", "number", "boolean", "object", etc.).
Complex Problem:


7.Write a function evaluateExpression that takes two numbers and a string representing an operator (e.g., "+", "-", "*", "/") as parameters. The function should perform the operation indicated by the operator and return the result. Handle division by zero appropriately.
Bonus Challenge
Ternary Operator:
8.Create a function getGrade that takes a score (0-100) as a parameter and returns a letter grade based on the following scale:
A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59
Use the ternary operator to determine the grade.
